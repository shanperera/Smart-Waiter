\end{enumerate}

\noindent If the scan is successful, the application will transition to the menu. Otherwise, the application will transition back to the scan page, and prompt to try again. 
\newline\newline
Please view Section \emph{5.2 - Bug Reporting} if you are having consistent errors scanning the barcode. 

\subsection{Menu Layout}
After successfully scanning a barcode, the application will transition to the restaurant menu. The layout is split into sections as you would see in a typical menu. The following sections are provided and described below.

\subsubsection{Menu Categories}
The first section called upon is menu categories. This is a single page that displays category names of a restaurant menu. Each category contains a list of items available to order at the restaurant.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{category.png}	\linebreak Figure 7\end{center}

\noindent To view items of a category, tap on the name. This will transition the page to menu items section.

\subsubsection{Menu Items}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Custom Toppings
  \item Custom Sides

\end{enumerate}

\noindent  Each method is presented on a separate page, and is shown in accordance to the item selected. This means, that you will have the ability to customize the item by choosing toppings, picking a side and by setting special instructions if applicable.
