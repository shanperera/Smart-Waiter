The user interface for this app will be simple minimal interface that allows the user to view restaurant menu and place an order with no complications. 
\subsubsection{Style Requirements}
The style of the app will be consistent between most pages by using a template. As well, the style will be consistent between multiple restaurants. Only menu items will change. Doing this would make it easier for the user to get used to the interface and keep it memorable.
\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}
\subsubsection{Ease of Use Requirements}
 The app will be easy to use for any casual customer equipped with a smart device in a dining establishment. This can range from an elementary student to a senior citizen.  
\subsubsection{Personalization and Internationalization Requirements}
Considering this app can be used in various ethic restaurants, customers may prefer to communicate in their own language. Thus, for a future functional requirement, the app will provide option to restaurant mangers to allow them to add an additional language setting. The app will always have English setting.

\subsubsection{Learning Requirements}
The learning curve will be kept as minimal as possible. The requirement is a user should be able to flawlessly use the app to view the restaurant menu and place and order without the use of a help function. The user should be comfortable and have complete understanding with this process as soon as he/she does it once. To meet this requirement, usability tests will be conducted to until high percentage of users feel comfortable with the process. We will add a help function which will allow users to seek help when required.


\subsubsection{Understandability and Politeness Requirements}
To promote understandability, appropriate images, text descriptions and symbols will be in place. That is, the user will understand this app is meant to serve as a menu and waiter by incorporating pictures, description and price of food available. A checkout button will clearly be indicated when the user is ready to place the order.
\subsubsection{Accessibility Requirements}
This app will be accessible to those with relatively good
eyesight and have use of their index finger. 
 
\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsubsection{Speed and Latency Requirements}
Query restaurant information should take no longer than
five seconds. Processing transactions should take no longer than
10 seconds.  

\subsubsection{Safety-Critical Requirements}
To maintain confidentiality, credit card and personal information will not be stored in the backend database. As well, an secure connection will always be instantiated when placing an order to ensure data protection. 

\subsubsection{Precision or Accuracy Requirements}
The restaurant will set all monetary amounts for food and beverages seen on the app. All appropriate taxes will be included in the bill when making an order.  This is covered in requirement number 9.

\subsubsection{Reliability and Availability Requirements}
Mobile app will be working whenever the user wants. However, services such as viewing menu and placing orders will only be available during restaurant hours.


\subsubsection{Robustness or Fault-Tolerance Requirements}
If the app fails to scan the QR code repeatedly (after 3 times), it will prompt the user to reach out to their waiter/waitress for service. 
%It will also provide an option to report this error.


\subsubsection{Capacity Requirements}
Multiple users within the restaurants must be able to use the application and place orders simultaneously.


\subsubsection{Scalability or Extensibility Requirements}
Increasing number of participating restaurants may induce database upgrade in terms of efficiency in querying. There is one database for each restaurant.


\subsubsection{Longevity Requirements}
App is relies on the restaurants business life. For example, if restaurant decides to shutdown, the app will no longer serve that restaurant.

\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}
\subsubsection{Expected Physical Environment}
Ordering component of the app will be functional only at restaurants. This includes, viewing a menu and placing an order. 

\subsubsection{Requirements for Interfacing with Adjacent Systems}
Our product must be compatible with various versions of android. The smart device must have a camera to operate.
\subsubsection{Productization Requirements}
App will be available on Google Play for download by customers.QR codes will be implemented at participating restaurants. These codes will be placed on tables so customers can scan appropriately if they have the app. 
\subsubsection{Release Requirements}
A new app release will not affect restaurant data or compromise 
integrity. For example, customers with an older app version would still be able to view the same information as those with updated version. 
\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}
\subsubsection{Maintenance Requirements}
Restaurants menu changes will be processed after restaurant hours and take effect the next day. This ensures all customers see the same information. 
\subsubsection{Supportability Requirements}
If a restaurant manager requires support on maintenance (updating menu items), they will log a request with us to make this change. Customers using the app will rely on self-support (download and update when new release is available).
\subsubsection{Adaptability Requirements}
For a future requirement, the app will be extended to other mobile platforms (IOS, blackberry, windows) 
\subsection{Security Requirements}
\subsubsection{Access Requirements}
User is only allowed access to restaurant data by scanning QR code. Other participating restaurants data will not be available unless they have QR code. 
\subsubsection{Integrity Requirements}
Credit information is never recorded on backend database, thus no chance of leakage.
\subsubsection{Privacy Requirements}
Will inform user that credit card information transactions will be secured through the use of encrypted connection. Also, will ensure restaurant mangers that data is read from QR code cannot be tampered with.
\subsubsection{Audit Requirements}

\section{Project Issues}
\subsection{Open Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item Amount of data to be queried is unknown as it is specific to each restaurant.
\item Amount of concurrent clients requesting data is variable. Will affect efficiency
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Off the Shelf Solutions}
\subsubsection{Ready Made Products}
N/A
\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
Stripe API will be incorporated as a form of payment system. This will reduce the hassle of reinventing a payment processing system. As well, it insures data integrity.
 \subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied} 
Open table  offers similar solution. However this product lacks functionality in terms of ordering. Similar UI can be constructed to appeal to mass audience.  
\subsection{New Problems}
N/A
\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop product prototype and perform testing 
  \item Introduce prototype to supervisor for feedback
  \item Work on revisions
  \item Design decisions need to be made
  \item Test plan should be designed to cover all use cases 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Migration to New Product}
N/A
\subsection{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dependency on third party API Stripe. If company happen to shut down, unable to process credit card payments until alternative solution is found
  \item Network threats. If new threats are discovered (e.g., heartbleed), may comprise data integrity. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Decisions}
The environment will require the following;
\begin{itemize}
  \item Source code will be written in Java because it is the only common language between third party API's used, and Android platform.
  \item 	Cloud storage must be used, because of the dynamic nature of the application. The menus cannot packaged with the application.
  \item 	A third party API or correct security features must be integrated into application to support credit card payments
  \item	Restaurant clients should not be able to dine and dash.
