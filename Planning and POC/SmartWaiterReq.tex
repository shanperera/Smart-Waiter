\subsubsection{Supportability Requirements}
If a restaurant manager requires support on maintenance (updating menu items), they will log a request with us to make this change. Customers using the app will rely on self-support (download and update when new release is available).
\subsubsection{Adaptability Requirements}
Might be extended to other mobile platforms (IOS, blackberry, windows) 
\subsection{Security Requirements}
\subsubsection{Access Requirements}
User is only allowed access to restaurant data by scanning QR code. Other participating restaurants data will not be available unless they have QR code. 
\subsubsection{Integrity Requirements}
Credit information is never recorded on backend database, thus no chance of leakage.
\subsubsection{Privacy Requirements}
Will inform user that credit card information transactions will be secured through the use of SSL. Also, will insure restaurant mangers data read from QR code cannot be tampered with. Issue a read only setting.
